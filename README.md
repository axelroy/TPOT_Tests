# TPOT_Tests

Repository to store the different experiments made with the TPOT library.

TPOT is actually under development, the current version is the 0.7.5, so the
following scripts might not work with the following versions.

Tests done :

* How to retrieve the different explored models. /retrieve_best_pipeline
* How does the export work, and what can we do with it. /export_example

To do tests :

* How to find the features used for the pipeline optimisation, and can we find from
  what the constructed ones have been made of.
